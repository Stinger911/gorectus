# Server Routes Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Refactored the `cmd/server/main.go` file to extract route groups into separate files for better maintainability and organization.

## Files Created

### 1. `routes.go`

- Contains the `RouteHandler` interface for all route handlers
- Defines `ServerInterface` to provide common methods needed by route handlers
- Implements `ServerInterface` for the `Server` struct

### 2. `auth_routes.go`

- Contains the `AuthHandler` struct and all authentication-related routes
- Handles: `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/me`
- Includes authentication middleware and login logic
- Manages JWT token generation and validation for authentication endpoints

### 3. `collections_routes.go`

- Contains the `CollectionsHandler` struct and all collection-related routes
- Handles: `/collections` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE operations)
- Currently contains placeholder implementations

### 4. `items_routes.go`

- Contains the `ItemsHandler` struct and all item-related routes
- Handles: `/items/:collection` and `/items/:collection/:id` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE operations)
- Currently contains placeholder implementations

### 5. `users_routes.go`

- Contains the `UsersHandler` struct and all user-related routes
- Handles: `/users` and `/users/:id` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE operations)
- Currently contains placeholder implementations

### 6. `roles_routes.go`

- Contains the `RolesHandler` struct and all role-related routes
- Handles: `/roles` and `/roles/:id` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE operations)
- Currently contains placeholder implementations

## Changes to `main.go`

### Removed

- All route handler methods (moved to respective route files)
- Route setup code (replaced with handler initialization)
- Unused import: `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` (now used in auth_routes.go)

### Modified

- `setupRoutes()` method now creates handler instances and calls their `SetupRoutes()` methods
- Simplified and more maintainable route setup

### Kept

- JWT helper functions (`generateJWT`, `validateJWT`)
- Main server initialization and database connection logic
- Health check endpoint
- Static file serving

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each route group is now in its own file, making the codebase easier to navigate
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to specific route groups can be made without affecting other parts
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each handler is responsible for its own route setup and implementation
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new route groups or extend existing ones
5. **Testing**: Route handlers can be tested independently

## Interface Design

The `ServerInterface` provides a clean abstraction for route handlers to access:

- Database connection via `GetDB()`
- Authentication middleware via `AuthMiddleware()`
- CORS options handler via `OptionsHandler()`

This design allows for easy testing and potential dependency injection in the future.

## Build Status

✅ All files compile successfully
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ No breaking changes to the API
